Health Analysis
This project involves an extensive analysis of a healthcare dataset. The analysis covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling to gain insights into patient demographics, medical conditions, and hospital operations. The notebook also includes visualizations to better understand trends and relationships within the data.

Project Overview:
Data Description:

The dataset contains information about patients admitted to a hospital, including demographic details, medical conditions, treatments, and billing information.
Key Columns:
Name: Patient's name.
Age: Patient's age at the time of admission.
Gender: Patient's gender.
Blood Type: Patient's blood type.
Medical Condition: The diagnosis or medical condition for which the patient is admitted.
Date of Admission: Admission date to the hospital.
Doctor: The attending physician.
Hospital: The hospital where the patient is admitted.
Insurance Provider: The provider covering the medical expenses.
Billing Amount: The total billed amount for services provided during the hospital stay.
Room Number: The room in which the patient stayed.
Admission Type: The type of admission (e.g., emergency, elective).
Discharge Date: The date the patient was discharged.
Medication: Medications prescribed during the stay.
Test Results: Results of medical tests conducted during hospitalization.
Data Preprocessing:

Date Conversion and Length of Stay Calculation: Date columns are converted to datetime format, and the length of stay is calculated by subtracting the admission date from the discharge date.
Readmission Indicator: A new feature is created to indicate whether a patient was readmitted.
Handling Missing Values and Categorical Data: Missing values are imputed, and categorical variables are encoded to prepare the data for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Gender Count: Distribution of patients by gender.
Age Distribution: Visualization of the age distribution across different medical conditions or hospital types.
Billing Analysis: Investigation into the billing amounts based on various factors such as age, gender, and medical condition.
Predictive Modeling:

Random Forest for Length of Stay Prediction:

A Random Forest model is trained to predict the length of a patient's hospital stay based on various features.
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
Cost Prediction:

The model predicts the billing amount for hospital stays, and the results are visualized to compare predicted vs. actual costs.
Conclusion:

The analysis provides valuable insights into patient demographics, medical conditions, and hospital operations. Predictive models like Random Forest offer accurate predictions for key outcomes such as length of stay and billing amounts, which can aid in resource planning and cost management.
How to Use:
Clone the Repository:

Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone.
Install Dependencies:

Install the required Python libraries listed in the requirements.txt file using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Notebook:

Open the notebook in Jupyter and execute the cells sequentially to perform the analysis and generate the results.
Conclusion:
This health analysis project demonstrates the power of data-driven insights in healthcare management. By preprocessing the data, conducting exploratory analysis, and building predictive models, we can better understand patient needs and optimize hospital resources.
